const text = `An address by Her Majesty The Queen on the 75th anniversary of VE Day
I speak to you today at the same hour as my father did, exactly 75 years ago. His message then was a salute to the men and women at home and abroad who had sacrificed so much in pursuit of what he rightly called a “great deliverance”. 
The war had been a total war; it had affected everyone, and no one was immune from its impact. Whether it be the men and women called up to serve; families separated from each other; or people asked to take up new roles and skills to support the war effort, all had a part to play.  At the start, the outlook seemed bleak, the end distant, the outcome uncertain. But we kept faith that the cause was right - and this belief, as my father noted in his broadcast, carried us through.
Never give up, never despair - that was the message of VE Day. I vividly remember the jubilant scenes my sister and I witnessed with our parents and Winston Churchill from the balcony of Buckingham Palace. The sense of joy in the crowds who gathered outside and across the country was profound, though while we celebrated the victory in Europe, we knew there would be further sacrifice.  It was not until August that fighting in the Far East ceased and the war finally ended.
Many people laid down their lives in that terrible conflict. They fought so we could live in peace, at home and abroad. They died so we could live as free people in a world of free nations. They risked all so our families and neighbourhoods could be safe. We should and will remember them. 
As I now reflect on my father’s words and the joyous celebrations, which some of us experienced first-hand, I am thankful for the strength and courage that the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and all our allies displayed.
The wartime generation knew that the best way to honour those who did not come back from the war, was to ensure that it didn’t happen again. The greatest tribute to their sacrifice is that countries who were once sworn enemies are now friends, working side by side for the peace, health and prosperity of us all.
Today it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish.  Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps. But our streets are not empty; they are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other. And when I look at our country today, and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire.
I send my warmest good wishes to you all.

The Queen's message to the people of Nova Scotia
Prince Philip and I have been deeply saddened by the appalling events in Nova Scotia, and we send our condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of those who have lost their lives.
I also pay tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of the officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other police services who selflessly responded to these devastating attacks, and to the emergency services who are supporting those who have been injured and affected.
My thoughts and prayers are with the people of Nova Scotia and all Canadians at this tragic time.

The Queen's Easter message
Many religions have festivals which celebrate light overcoming darkness.      Such occasions are often accompanied by the lighting of candles. They seem to speak to every culture, and appeal to people of all faiths, and of none. They are lit on birthday cakes and to mark family anniversaries, when we gather happily around a source of light. It unites us.
As darkness falls on the Saturday before Easter Day, many Christians would normally light candles together. In church, one light would pass to another, spreading slowly and then more rapidly as more candles are lit. It’s a way of showing how the good news of Christ’s resurrection has been passed on from the first Easter by every generation until now.
This year, Easter will be different for many of us, but by keeping apart we keep others safe. But Easter isn’t cancelled; indeed, we need Easter as much as ever. The discovery of the risen Christ on the first Easter Day gave his followers new hope and fresh purpose, and we can all take heart from this. We know that Coronavirus will not overcome us. As dark as death can be — particularly for those suffering with grief — light and life are greater. May the living flame of the Easter hope be a steady guide as we face the future.
I wish everyone of all faiths and denominations a blessed Easter.

The Queen's broadcast to the UK and Commonwealth
I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time. A time of disruption in the life of our country: a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many, and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all.

I want to thank everyone on the NHS front line, as well as care workers and those carrying out essential roles, who selflessly continue their day-to-day duties outside the home in support of us all. I am sure the nation will join me in assuring you that what you do is appreciated and every hour of your hard work brings us closer to a return to more normal times.
I also want to thank those of you who are staying at home, thereby helping to protect the vulnerable and sparing many families the pain already felt by those who have lost loved ones. Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it.
I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. And those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterise this country. The pride in who we are is not a part of our past, it defines our present and our future. 
The moments when the United Kingdom has come together to applaud its care and essential workers will be remembered as an expression of our national spirit; and its symbol will be the rainbows drawn by children.
Across the Commonwealth and around the world, we have seen heart-warming stories of people coming together to help others, be it through delivering food parcels and medicines, checking on neighbours, or converting businesses to help the relief effort. 
And though self-isolating may at times be hard, many people of all faiths, and of none, are discovering that it presents an opportunity to slow down, pause and reflect, in prayer or meditation.
It reminds me of the very first broadcast I made, in 1940, helped by my sister. We, as children, spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety. Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones. But now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do.
While we have faced challenges before, this one is different. This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed - and that success will belong to every one of us.

We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.
But for now, I send my thanks and warmest good wishes to you all. 

The Queen's 2020 Commonwealth Day Message
On Commonwealth occasions, it is always inspiring to be reminded of the diversity of the people and countries that make up our worldwide family.  We are made aware of the many associations and influences that combine through Commonwealth connection, helping us to imagine and deliver a common future.
This is particularly striking when we see people from nations, large and small, gathering for the Commonwealth Games, for meetings of Commonwealth governments, and on Commonwealth Day.  Such a blend of traditions serves to make us stronger, individually and collectively, by providing the ingredients needed for social, political and economic resilience.
Throughout my life, I have had the opportunity to see and hear how membership of the Commonwealth family means so much to those living in all parts of the world, often in places that are quite remote.  Advances in technology and modern media have now enabled many more people to witness and enjoy - with remarkable immediacy - this experience of Commonwealth connection, in areas such as education, medicine and conservation.
Looking to the future, this connectivity means we are also aware, perhaps as never before, that wherever we live, our choices and actions affect the well-being of people and communities living far away, and in very different circumstances.  For many, this awareness awakens a desire to employ our planet’s natural resources with greater care, and it is encouraging to see how the countries of the Commonwealth continue to devise new ways of working together to achieve prosperity, whilst protecting our planet.
As members of this very special community, on this Commonwealth Day, I hope that the people and countries of the Commonwealth will be inspired by all that we share, and move forward with fresh resolve to enhance the Commonwealth’s influence for good in our world.

The Queen's remarks during her visit to MI5
I would like to take my visit here today as an opportunity to thank you all for the tireless work you do to keep our country safe.  I am always struck by the remarkable resolve with which you carry out your vital role.

There will no doubt continue to be significant threats and challenges ahead.  But on each of my visits to MI5, I have been impressed by the way that you have adapted to the changing threats to our nation.  Whether responding to the threats from the Nazis or the Cold War, domestic terrorism or the cyber sphere, you have always demonstrated the utmost commitment to your motto: “Regnum Defende”. 
Because of the nature of your work, it is without public recognition, so it is on behalf of the country that I say to you all, thank you.

The Queen’s Christmas Broadcast 2019
As a child, I never imagined that one day a man would walk on the moon.  Yet this year we marked the fiftieth anniversary of the famous Apollo 11 mission. As those historic pictures were beamed backed to earth, millions of us sat transfixed to our television screens, as we watched Neil Armstrong taking a small step for man and a giant leap for mankind and, indeed, for womankind. It’s a reminder for us all that giant leaps often start with small steps.
This year we marked another important anniversary: D-Day. On 6th June 1944, some one hundred and fifty-six thousand British, Canadian and American forces landed in Northern France. It was the largest ever seaborne invasion and was delayed due to bad weather.  I well remember the look of concern on my father’s face. He knew the secret D-Day plans but could of course share that burden with no-one.
For the Seventy-Fifth Anniversary of that decisive battle, in a true spirit of reconciliation, those who had formerly been sworn enemies came together in friendly commemorations either side of the Channel, putting past differences behind them.
Such reconciliation seldom happens overnight. It takes patience and time to rebuild trust, and progress often comes through small steps. Since the end of the Second World War, many charities, groups and organisations have worked to promote peace and unity around the world, bringing together those who have been on opposing sides. By being willing to put past differences behind us and move forward together, we honour the freedom and democracy once won for us at so great a cost.
The challenges many people face today may be different to those once faced by my generation, but I have been struck by how new generations have brought a similar sense of purpose to issues such as protecting our environment and our climate.
My family and I are also inspired by the men and women of our emergency services and Armed Forces; and at Christmas we remember all those on duty at home and abroad, who are helping those in need and keeping us and our families safe and secure.
Two hundred years on from the birth of my great, great grandmother, Queen Victoria, Prince Philip and I have been delighted to welcome our eighth great grandchild into our family.  Of course, at the heart of the Christmas story lies the birth of a child: a seemingly small and insignificant step overlooked by many in Bethlehem.  But in time, through his teaching and by his example, Jesus Christ would show the world how small steps taken in faith and in hope can overcome long-held differences and deep-seated divisions to bring harmony and understanding.  Many of us already try to follow in his footsteps. The path, of course, is not always smooth, and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy, but small steps can make a world of difference.
As Christmas dawned, church congregations around the world joined in singing It Came Upon the Midnight Clear.  Like many timeless carols, it speaks not just of the coming of Jesus Christ into a divided world, many years ago, but also of the relevance, even today, of the angels’ message of peace and goodwill.
It’s a timely reminder of what positive things can be achieved when people set aside past differences and come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation. And, as we all look forward to the start of a new decade, it’s worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change.
And so, I wish you all a very happy Christmas.
 
The Queen's speech on awarding Sir David Attenborough the Chatham House Prize
As Patron of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, I am delighted that members have awarded this year’s Chatham House Prize to Sir David Attenborough and the Blue Planet Two team.
Sir David, this award recognises your many talents and one can’t help but feel that, for those of us of a certain generation, we can take great pleasure in proving age is no barrier to being a positive influence.
Your ability to communicate the beauty and vulnerability of our natural environment remains unequalled as you – and your team – have engaged and enthused many people, young and old, to appreciate and preserve our world’s oceans.  For that we should all be thankful.
I congratulate you and all involved in this endeavour.

Her Majesty The Queen's Scottish Parliament Speech
Presiding Officer, First Minister, Members of the Scottish Parliament, The Duke of Rothesay and I are pleased to join you today in marking the Twentieth Anniversary of the Scottish Parliament.
We fondly remember that proud day, when new Members gathered in the Assembly Hall to celebrate Scotland’s first parliament in 300 years. 
I have noted on previous occasions my great affection for Scotland, and the many happy and personal connections I enjoy with this wonderful country.  It has been with great pleasure that over the years I have watched Scotland grow and prosper, and have been with you at each stage of your parliamentary life, including on landmark occasions such as today. 
Twenty years on, this chamber continues to be at the centre of Scottish life, as an important forum to engage and unite diverse communities and also a home for passionate debate and discussion.  Through new initiatives you continue to strive to be responsive and accountable to the people you serve, and to engage and involve those who might not otherwise participate in political debate.
It is perhaps worth reflecting that at the heart of the word “Parliament” lies its original meaning: a place to talk. I have no doubt that for most of these last twenty years this striking chamber has provided exactly that, a place to talk. But of course it must also be a place to listen --- a place to hear views that inevitably may differ quite considerably, one from another --- and a place to honour those views. In turn, this occasion today gives us all an opportunity to honour those who help turn talk into action, not just Members of the Scottish Parliament but all those behind the scenes -- the many unseen, unsung individuals who are not afforded recognition by the nature of their role in Parliament, but who nonetheless join together to support parliamentary work in the service of others, and the success of the nation as a whole.
Presiding Officer, as we look to the future, it is my sincere hope that this Parliament, and all those who come to serve in it, will use the power of this chamber to celebrate those invisible pillars of our communities, and follow their example by working tirelessly to improve people’s lives, and strengthen the bonds of friendship and partnership both at home and abroad. 
Today, with the echo of excitement and enthusiasm I encountered twenty years ago, I extend to you all my warmest good wishes on this special anniversary, for the continuing prosperity of the people of Scotland, and for those who represent them in this remarkable Parliament.

The Queen's speech at commemorations to mark the 75th anniversary of D-Day
Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
When I attended the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the D-Day Landings, some thought it might be the last such event. But the wartime generation - my generation - is resilient, and I am delighted to be with you in Portsmouth today.
75 years ago, hundreds of thousands of young soldiers, sailors and airmen left these shores in the cause of freedom. In a broadcast to the nation at that time, my Father, King George VI, said: “…what is demanded from us all is something more than courage and endurance; we need a revival of spirit, a new unconquerable resolve...” That is exactly what those brave men brought to the battle, as the fate of the world depended on their success.
Many of them would never return, and the heroism, courage and sacrifice of those who lost their lives will never be forgotten. It is with humility and pleasure, on behalf of the entire country – indeed the whole free world – that I say to you all, thank you.

The Queen's speech at the US State Banquet
Mr President,
I am delighted to welcome you and Mrs Trump to Buckingham Palace this evening, just twelve months after our first meeting at Windsor. Visits by American Presidents always remind us of the close and longstanding friendship between the United Kingdom and the United States, and I am so glad that we have another opportunity to demonstrate the immense importance that both our countries attach to our relationship. 
In the coming days, you will see some of our most treasured historical buildings, speak to the business leaders whose expertise and innovation drive our economies, and meet members of our Armed Services, past and present. You will also travel to Portsmouth and Normandy to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of D-Day. 
On that day – and on many occasions since – the Armed Forces of both our countries fought side-by-side to defend our cherished values of liberty and democracy. Mr President, in your State of the Union Address this year, you paid tribute to some of the American heroes who risked their lives, and we owe an immeasurable debt to the British, American and Allied soldiers who began the liberation of Europe on 6th June 1944. 
I paid my first State Visit to your country at the invitation of President Eisenhower. As Supreme Allied Commander, he had ultimate responsibility for the execution of the Normandy landings. In his headquarters in St James’s Square – not far from Buckingham Palace – British and American officers worked closely together to plan the freedom of a continent, and it would be no exaggeration to say that millions of lives depended on their common endeavour.
As we face the new challenges of the Twenty First Century, the anniversary of D-Day reminds us of all that our countries have achieved together. After the shared sacrifices of the Second World War, Britain and the United States worked with other allies to build an assembly of international institutions, to ensure that the horrors of conflict would never be repeated. While the world has changed, we are forever mindful of the original purpose of these structures: nations working together to safeguard a hard won peace. 
Of course, it is not only our security which unites us; but our strong cultural links and shared heritage. Every year, there are almost four million visits by Americans to the United Kingdom, with a great number claiming British descent. And with your own Scottish ancestry, Mr President, you too have a particular connection to this country. 
We are also bound by the strength and breadth of our economic ties, as the largest investors in each other’s economies. British companies in the United States employ over one million Americans, and the same is true vice versa. 
Mr President, as we look to the future, I am confident that our common values and shared interests will continue to unite us. Tonight we celebrate an alliance that has helped to ensure the safety and prosperity of both our peoples for decades, and which I believe will endure for many years to come.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I invite you all to rise and drink a toast to President and Mrs Trump, to the continued friendship between our two nations, and to the health, prosperity and happiness of the people of the United States.

A Commonwealth Day Message from Her Majesty The Queen
Commonwealth Day has a special significance this year as we mark the 70th anniversary of the London Declaration, when nations of the Commonwealth agreed to move forward together as free and equal members. The vision and sense of connection that inspired the signatories has stood the test of time, and the Commonwealth continues to grow, adapting to address contemporary needs.
Today, many millions of people around the world are drawn together because of the collective values shared by the Commonwealth. In April last year, I welcomed the leaders of our 53 nations to Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, and we all witnessed how the Commonwealth vision offers hope, and inspires us to find ways of protecting our planet, and our people.
We are able to look to the future with greater confidence and optimism as a result of the links that we share, and thanks to the networks of cooperation and mutual support to which we contribute, and on which we draw. With enduring commitment through times of great change, successive generations have demonstrated that whilst the goodwill for which the Commonwealth is renowned may be intangible, its impact is very real.
We experience this as people of all backgrounds continue to find new ways of expressing through action the value of belonging in a connected Commonwealth. I hope and trust that many more will commit to doing so this Commonwealth Day.

The Queen’s Christmas Broadcast 2018
For many, the service of Nine Lessons and Carols from King’s College, Cambridge, is when Christmas begins. Listened to by millions of people around the world, it starts with a chorister singing the first verse of Once in Royal David’s City. 
The priest who introduced this service to King’s College chapel, exactly one hundred years ago, was Eric Milner-White.  He had served as a military chaplain in the First World War. Just six weeks after the Armistice, he wanted a new kind of service which - with its message of peace and goodwill - spoke to the needs of the times.
2018 has been a year of centenaries.  The Royal Air Force celebrated its 100th anniversary with a memorable fly-past demonstrating a thrilling unity of purpose and execution.  We owe them and all our Armed Services our deepest gratitude. 
My father served in the Royal Navy during the First World War.  He was a midshipman in HMS Collingwood at the Battle of Jutland in 1916.  The British fleet lost 14 ships and 6,000 men in that engagement.  My father wrote in a letter: “How and why we were not hit beats me”.  Like others, he lost friends in the war.  At Christmas, we become keenly aware of loved ones who have died, whatever the circumstances.  But of course, we would not grieve if we did not love.
Closer to home, it’s been a busy year for my family, with two weddings and two babies – and another child expected soon.  It helps to keep a grandmother well occupied.  We have had other celebrations too, including the 70th birthday of The Prince of Wales.
Some cultures believe a long life brings wisdom.  I’d like to think so.  Perhaps part of that wisdom is to recognise some of life’s baffling paradoxes, such as the way human beings have a huge propensity for good, and yet a capacity for evil.  Even the power of faith, which frequently inspires great generosity and self-sacrifice, can fall victim to tribalism.  But through the many changes I have seen over the years, faith, family and friendship have been not only a constant for me but a source of personal comfort and reassurance.
In April, the Commonwealth Heads of Government met in London.  My father welcomed just 8 countries to the first such meeting in 1948.  Now the Commonwealth includes 53 countries with 2.4 billion people, a third of the world’s population.  Its strength lies in the bonds of affection it promotes, and a common desire to live in a better, more peaceful world.  Even with the most deeply held differences, treating the other person with respect and as a fellow human-being is always a good first step towards greater understanding. Indeed, the Commonwealth Games, held this year on Australia’s Gold Coast, are known universally as the Friendly Games because of their emphasis on goodwill and mutual respect.
The Christmas story retains its appeal since it doesn’t provide theoretical explanations for the puzzles of life.  Instead it’s about the birth of a child and the hope that birth -- 2,000 years ago -- brought to the world.  Only a few people acknowledged Jesus when he was born.  Now billions follow him.  I believe his message of peace-on-earth and goodwill-to-all is never out of date.  It can be heeded by everyone.  It’s needed as much as ever. 
A very happy Christmas to you all.


The Queen's speech at The Netherlands State Banquet
Your Majesty,
Prince Charles and I are delighted to welcome you and Queen Máxima to Buckingham Palace this evening. 
Through this State visit, we celebrate the enduring friendship which has enabled our two nations to prosper and grow, side by side, as trading partners, and as North Sea neighbours.  This visit also provides the opportunity for great happiness, and to welcome old friends to my home. 
Over the many hundreds of years of our shared history, there are few nations who are able to claim a closer bond.  This year marks the three hundred and thirtieth anniversary of the Glorious Revolution, when your ancestor, Prince William III of Orange, came to these shores and restored stability after turbulence.
Over 250 years later, in 1940, Queen Wilhelmina rallied the Government in Exile.  She became a source of inspiration from London during the Second World War, and upon her return to The Netherlands a symbol of liberation.  
Through Your Majesty’s visits and your acts of friendship, you have formed your own personal connection with the British people.  During your time as a sixth form student at Atlantic College in Wales, you kept our local communities safe by volunteering for the Life Boat service, embodying the true spirit of friends supporting one another. 
To this day, our close relationship greatly contributes to the economic and cultural life of Britain.  The Netherlands are one of The United Kingdom’s largest European investors.  We have a thriving Dutch community, and artistic and sporting exchanges are at an all time high.  British universities are a top destination for Dutch students, and hundreds of Dutch and British scientists are teaching, researching and collaborating in both countries. 
Internationally we have a strong shared commitment to the transatlantic alliance, and it is no coincidence that of the last twelve Secretaries General of NATO, six have been either British or Dutch.
Our deep bond is seen in our obligation to uphold the rule of law in the United Nations Security Council and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons based in The Hague.  It is also evident in our daily co-operation to combat cross border crime and terrorism.
I recall the State Visit of your grandmother Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard in 1972, when I spoke of how our nations’ close understanding and relationship would become increasingly important as a new configuration of Europe was emerging.  As we look toward a new partnership with Europe, it is our shared values and commitment to each other, that are our greatest asset, and demonstrate that even through change, our enduring alliance remains strong, and as innovators, traders and internationalists we look with confidence to the future.   
As we continue to work together to ensure peace, prosperity and security, I am confident that this friendship between The United Kingdom and The Netherlands, which we greatly treasure, will continue to deepen, and to prosper.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I invite you all to rise and drink a toast to Their Majesties, The King and Queen, and the people of The Netherlands. 

A speech by The Queen to mark the 100th Anniversary of The Royal Air Force
Chief of the Air Staff, today is a very special day.
Presenting the Royal Air Force with a New Queen's Colour provides an opportunity to congratulate the Service for your remarkable contribution to Defence over the last hundred years.
Tenacity, skill and gallantry have been your hallmarks, as you have helped to safeguard freedom and security in many parts of the world. I remember the Battle of Britain being fought in the skies above us, and we shall never forget the courage and sacrifice of that time.
          In 1918, my father, King George VI, served alongside one of the Service's founders, Lord Trenchard, before becoming the first of my family to qualify as a Royal Air Force pilot. That family tradition continues to this day: The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales and The Duke of Cambridge have all earned their Wings, and wear them with great pride.
          The Royal Air Force has won a place in the heart of our Nation, and I wish All Ranks, past and present, together with your families, every good fortune for your second century of service.
Per Ardua Ad Astra.

A Speech given by Her Majesty The Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, at the Formal Opening of CHOGM
Prime Minister Muscat, Prime Minister May, Secretary-General, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Having on so many occasions been welcomed to opening ceremonies around the Commonwealth, it is a pleasure this time to welcome you to my own home.
Here at Buckingham Palace in 1949, my father met the Heads of Government when they ratified the London Declaration, which created the Commonwealth as we know it today – then comprising just eight nations.
Who then -- or in 1952, when I became Head of the Commonwealth -- would have guessed that a gathering of its member states would one day number 53, or that it would comprise 2.4 billion people?
Put simply, we are one of the world's great convening powers: a global association of volunteers who believe in the tangible benefits that flow from exchanging ideas and experiences and respecting each other's point of view.
And we seem to be growing stronger year by year. The advantages are plain to see. An increasing emphasis on trade between our countries is helping us all to discover exciting new ways of doing business. And imaginative initiatives have shown how together we can bring about change on a global scale. The Commonwealth Canopy has emphasised our interdependence, while the Commonwealth Blue Charter promises to do the same in protecting our shared ocean resources. The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust is providing life-changing eye treatment to many thousands, through the generosity and cooperation of the nations represented here today.
My family and I have been heartened by these and the many other programmes in which we are proud to play a part. 
I am glad to see that young people, connecting through technology, are becoming ever more involved.  When I meet the young leaders of this century, I remember my own life-long commitment – made in South Africa in 1947 at the age of 21. As another birthday approaches this week, I am reminded of the extraordinary journey we have been on, and how much good has been achieved.
It remains a great pleasure and honour to serve you as Head of the Commonwealth and to observe, with pride and satisfaction, that this is a flourishing network.  It is my sincere wish that the Commonwealth will continue to offer stability and continuity for future generations, and will decide that one day The Prince of Wales should carry on the important work started by my father in 1949.  By continuing to treasure and reinvigorate our associations and activities, I believe we will secure a safer, more prosperous and sustainable world for those who follow us: a world where the Commonwealth's generosity of spirit can bring its gentle touch of healing and hope to all.
Mindful as always that this summit of Commonwealth leaders draws its mandate and authority from our member countries collectively, it gives me great pleasure to declare this meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government open."


The Christmas Broadcast 2017
Sixty years ago today, I spoke about the speed of technological change, in what was my first televised Christmas broadcast.  At the time, it felt like a landmark: 
"Television has made it possible for many of you to see me in your homes on Christmas Day. My own family often gather round to watch television as they are at this moment, and that is how I imagine you now."
Six decades on, the presenter of that broadcast has 'evolved' somewhat, as has the technology she described.  Back then, who could have imagined that people would one day be following this Christmas message on laptops and mobile phones?  But I'm also struck by something that hasn't changed.  That, whatever the technology, many of you will be watching or listening to this at home. 
We think of our homes as places of warmth, familiarity and love; of shared stories and memories, which is perhaps why at this time of year so many return to where they grew up.  There is a timeless simplicity to the pull of home. 
For many, the idea of “home” reaches beyond a physical building – to a home town or city.  This Christmas, I think of London and Manchester, whose powerful identities shone through over the past twelve months in the face of appalling attacks.  In Manchester, those targeted included children who had gone to see their favourite singer.  A few days after the bombing, I had the privilege of meeting some of the young survivors and their parents.
I describe that hospital visit as a “privilege” because the patients I met were an example to us all, showing extraordinary bravery and resilience.  Indeed, many of those who survived the attack came together just days later for a benefit concert.  It was a powerful reclaiming of the ground, and of the city those young people call home. 
We expect our homes to be a place of safety – “sanctuary” even – which makes it all the more shocking when the comfort they provide is shattered.  A few weeks ago, The Prince of Wales visited the Caribbean in the aftermath of hurricanes that destroyed entire communities.  And here in London, who can forget the sheer awfulness of the Grenfell Tower fire? 
Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who died and those who lost so much; and we are indebted to members of the emergency services who risked their own lives, this past year, saving others.  Many of them, of course, will not be at home today because they are working, to protect us.
Reflecting on these events makes me grateful for the blessings of home and family, and in particular for 70 years of marriage.  I don’t know that anyone had invented the term “platinum” for a 70th wedding anniversary when I was born.  You weren’t expected to be around that long.  Even Prince Philip has decided it’s time to slow down a little – having, as he economically put it, “done his bit”.  But I know his support and unique sense of humour will remain as strong as ever, as we enjoy spending time this Christmas with our family and look forward to welcoming new members into it next year. 
In 2018 I will open my home to a different type of family: the leaders of the fifty-two nations of the Commonwealth, as they gather in the UK for a summit.  The Commonwealth has an inspiring way of bringing people together, be it through the Commonwealth Games – which begins in a few months’ time on Australia’s Gold Coast – or through bodies like the Commonwealth Youth Orchestra & Choir: a reminder of how truly vibrant this international family is. 
Today we celebrate Christmas, which itself is sometimes described as a festival of the home.  Families travel long distances to be together.  Volunteers and charities, as well as many churches, arrange meals for the homeless and those who would otherwise be alone on Christmas Day.     We remember the birth of Jesus Christ whose only sanctuary was a stable in Bethlehem.  He knew rejection, hardship and persecution; and yet it is Jesus Christ’s generous love and example which has inspired me through good times and bad.  Whatever your own experiences this year; wherever and however you are watching or listening, I wish you a peaceful and very happy Christmas. 

The Queen's speech at the commissioning ceremony of HMS Queen Elizabeth
We are gathered here in Portsmouth today just a short distance from HMS Victory – a flagship of our seafaring past and a reminder of the debt we owe to the Royal Navy, which for more than five hundred years has protected the people of this country and our interests around the world.
Like HMS Victory, HMS Queen Elizabeth embodies the best of British technology and innovation – a true flagship for the 21st century. The most powerful and capable ship ever to raise the White Ensign,  she will, in the years and decades ahead, represent this country’s resolve on the global stage. 
At the forefront of these responsibilities will be the men and women of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, supported by the Army, Royal Air Force, and by coalition partners.
As the daughter, wife and mother of naval officers, I recognise the unique demands our nation asks of you; and I will always value my special link with HMS Queen Elizabeth, her ship’s company and their families.
As you prepare to take this country’s message of peace, partnership and prosperity across the seas and oceans of the world, The Lord High Admiral, The Duke of Edinburgh, joins me in wishing you well in all your endeavours.

A Message from The Queen at the opening of the 2017 IAAF World Championships at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium
I was delighted to open the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in this very stadium and I know it holds extraordinary memories for competitors and spectators alike.
Sport has a way of uniting the world and reminds us what amazing things can be achieved when people come together to celebrate the very best of human endeavour.
I have no doubt that more wonderful memories will be created over the next ten days, and that the performances beginning tonight will serve as an inspiration to people across the world.
To the athletes, the officials, the volunteers and supporters, the spectators in the stadium and indeed to the millions watching around the world, I send my sincere good wishes for a happy, exciting and hugely successful 2017 IAAF World Championships.
Good luck to you all.

The Queen's speech at the Spanish State Banquet
Your Majesty,
The Duke of Edinburgh and I are delighted to welcome you and Queen Letizia to Buckingham Palace this evening.  
This State Visit is an expression of the deep respect and friendship that describes relations between Spain and the United Kingdom.  Just occasionally, a State Visit can provide an opportunity for great personal happiness also.  So it was, more than a century ago, when your great-grandfather, King Alfonso the Thirteenth, met his future wife, Princess Victoria Eugenie, the grand-daughter of our Queen Victoria, in this very ballroom.
The new Queen of Spain cemented strong ties between us, a link honoured by the service in the Royal Navy of your grandfather, Don Juan, Count of Barcelona.   
Prince Philip and I recall with affection the State Visit of 1986 made by your parents, during which King Juan Carlos addressed both Houses of Parliament.  His Majesty was the first foreign monarch ever to do so, which was a tribute to his role in Spain’s transition to democracy and acknowledgment that he was a King for all Spaniards.
Your father spoke proudly about Your Majesty that day.  You had just come of age, swearing loyalty in your Parliament to the Spanish Constitution.  These years later, those duties are now yours, supporting Spain’s thriving democracy.  It is therefore altogether fitting that Your Majesty, too, has addressed our Houses of Parliament today. 
The relationship between our two nations is dynamic and modern.  We are NATO allies, striving together to improve security in Europe and across the globe.  Our armed forces are currently working side by side in the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, led last year by Spain and now by the United Kingdom.  We remain deeply committed to the common defence and freedom of our countries.
There are so many facets to our shared experiences and close connections.  Indeed, the lives of our peoples themselves are more intertwined than ever before.  Thousands of Spanish students are studying at British universities, and Spanish scientists are working with British colleagues to tackle disease.  We are also significant investors in each other’s economies, with the United Kingdom being the principal European recipient of Spanish overseas investment.
A relationship like ours, founded on such great strengths and common interests, will ensure that both our nations prosper, now and in the future, whatever challenges arise.  With such a remarkable shared history, it is inevitable that there are matters on which we have not always seen eye to eye.  But the strength of our friendship has bred a resilient spirit of cooperation and goodwill.
Your Majesty, our countries are reliable partners and friends. We deeply appreciate the significant contribution that Spain continues to make to this country and assure you of our enduring friendship in the future.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I invite you all to rise and drink a toast to Their Majesties The King and Queen, and the people of Spain.

The Queen addresses The Royal Lancers at Windsor Castle
Brigadier Hughes,
I wish it had been possible for the whole Regiment to attend this ceremony, but I am talking as much to those at Catterick as to this representative party.
In the short time since I attended your amalgamation, you have established yourselves as a unified Regiment and a force without match. It gives me much pleasure to present to you your new Guidon.
The Guidon symbolises sacred loyalty to your Sovereign, your country, and to all of the officers and men with whom you serve. Your loyalty and devotion to duty have been tested over more than three hundred years, and never found to be wanting. Acts of bravery and skill-at-arms run through your regimental history, and many of your most famous feats are recalled here, carried on this Guidon.
To mark my 70th anniversary as your Colonel in Chief I should like to grant you a further distinction – that of an honorific suffix to The Royal Lancers – Queen Elizabeths’ Own - in recognition of your loyal service to me and to my mother, Queen Elizabeth.
I entrust this Guidon to your care, confident that the Officers, Non Commissioned Officers and Men of The Royal Lancers will maintain the same high standards as your forebears. I pray that God’s blessing will go with you.

The Queen’s Speech at the State Banquet in honour of the President of the Republic of Colombia
Mr. President,
Prince Philip and I are delighted to welcome you and Señora Clemencia Rodriguez de Santos to Buckingham Palace.
It has been five years since we first met, during your last official visit to London, a city where you have previously studied and worked.
Colombia's liberator, Simon Bolivar, also knew London well. After he came here to seek this country's help, thousands of British and Irish soldiers went to Colombia to help it re-gain its independence, along with substantial finance and other support.
Some two hundred years later, we continue to be close partners in so many areas, and the United Kingdom is proud to be one of your largest foreign investors, as well as being the top international study destination for Colombian postgraduates.  Indeed, tomorrow, you will return to the London School of Economics to set out your vision for Colombia’s future and the role young people can play in it.
Of course, our trading relationship is two-way. While British interests in Colombia include infrastructure, healthcare and energy, we also benefit from Colombian produce here in the U.K.  I am most grateful to your Ambassador for his gift of two of these world-famous products: Colombian flowers form part of this evening's floral arrangements, and the Colombian coffee we enjoyed at today's lunch will also be served later this evening and at tomorrow morning's business breakfast meeting.  Which should ensure that everyone is wide awake. 
Two years ago, when The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall were in Colombia, they saw the unparalleled beauty and biodiversity of your country, and the friendship and warmth of the Colombian people – as well as experiencing Bogotá's wonderful climate.
Mr President, your visit comes at a defining moment, not just in our shared history, but also for Colombia. 
The Colombian author Laura Restrepo once wrote, "War or indifference; it's hard to know which is the hardest to fight " - a phrase which continues to ring true in this uncertain world.  It is a reminder that the waging of peace is the hardest form of leadership of all, but also the most rewarding. 
Finding the balance between deeply-held opposing views, while never forgetting the needs of the disengaged, requires patience, resourcefulness and grit. 
Although you have faced recent setbacks, to have come to the cusp of a historic peace agreement, against the expectations of many, is a testament to your courage and perseverance, and that of the Colombian people.  I am delighted that this determination in the face of considerable challenges was given the highest possible recognition, through the award of the 2016 Nobel Prize for Peace.
This week you will visit Northern Ireland, which now has the largest financial services market in the United Kingdom outside London.  Over recent years, I have seen at close hand the transformation of a people held back for so many years by conflict and now, through peace, beginning to realise their full potential. 
As you embark on the long journey towards a stable and lasting peace, the United Kingdom will be alongside you.  Where we can, we will provide commercial, technical and political support that your country might need after decades of conflict, just as we did two centuries ago. 
In that way, I am sure of a shared, bright future for both of our countries as long-standing allies working together towards global peace and prosperity.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I ask you to rise and drink a toast to the President and Señora Rodriguez de Santos, and to the people of Colombia.

The Queen's Response to the Chief Engineer, on the Corps of Royal Engineers 300th anniversary
 Chief Royal Engineer - it gives me great pleasure to be here today, to see my Corps and its capabilities in this, the 300th Year of existence.    I am delighted to be able to share with you, and everyone present here, this significant milestone in the history of the Corps.
 
Since 2007, when I last visited Chatham, you have been at the forefront of innovation and military engineering.  Your achievements on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have been extraordinary, as has been your work in many other places.
 
Your ability to provide a flexible and adaptable force, quickly and without fuss, for the purposes of warfighting, peace building or disaster relief is world-class.  Whilst the wide range of skills and trades that are on display today give truth to your mottos “Everywhere” and “Where Right and Glory Lead”, it is your collective dedication and obvious professionalism that so easily impresses and is the legacy of those who have served before you.
 
The Corps of Royal Engineers has served the Nation proudly since 1716, often at the forefront of operations and often in difficult circumstances. You and your families have always risen to those challenges; I congratulate you on reaching this point in your long and distinguished service and I would wish all Sappers, wherever they may be, every success and good fortune in the future


The Queen's address to the Scottish Parliament, 2nd July 2016
Presiding Officer, First Minister, Members of the Scottish Parliament, it is a pleasure to be invited to address you on this special occasion to mark the opening of the fifth session of the Scottish Parliament.
I would like to begin by thanking you, Presiding Officer, for your kind words of welcome, and extending my good wishes to you in your new role. You carry a heavy responsibility for protecting the reputation and good conduct of this Parliament and I have no doubt that you will follow in the steps of your predecessors in demonstrating fairness, good judgement and impartiality, as well as being a strong advocate of the Parliament.
Members of the Scottish Parliament, occasions such as today are rightly a time for hope and optimism. The beginning of this new session in particular brings with it a real sense of renewal, with your largest intake of new Members since 1999.  For me, it also brings an echo of the excitement and enthusiasm I encountered that year , when many of the then MSPs ---  and I am pleased to note quite a number of you are still serving today --- set out on a collective journey in Scottish public service.   
Seventeen years on, the Scottish Parliament has grown in maturity and skill.  Of course, we all live and work in an increasingly complex and demanding world, where events and developments can, and do, take place at remarkable speed; and retaining the ability to stay calm and collected can at times be hard.  As this Parliament has successfully demonstrated over the years, one hallmark of leadership in such a fast-moving world is allowing sufficient room for quiet thinking and contemplation, which can enable deeper, cooler consideration of how challenges and opportunities can be best addressed.  
I am sure, also, you will continue to draw inspiration from the founding principles of the Parliament and the key values of Wisdom, Justice, Compassion and Integrity that are engraved on the mace.  These principles and values have already served the Scottish Parliament well and they will continue to guide new and returning members in the years ahead.
During this session, the Parliament will implement significant new tax and welfare powers in addition to other areas of public policy.  I wish you every success as you prepare to take on these extra responsibilities, and I remain confident that you will use the powers at your disposal wisely and continue to serve the interests of all the people of Scotland to the best of your ability.
As well as formally marking the opening of the fifth session of the Scottish Parliament, today is also a day where people will come together in Edinburgh to celebrate excellence in Scotland.  And I can say, without fear of contradiction, that there is certainly a lot to celebrate!  Today we are reminded of Edwin Morgan’s poem, “Open The Doors!” and I understand that this afternoon's activities are themed around that poem, which famously has the line, “We have a building that is more than a building”.  
What a wonderful way of describing this Parliament!
Presiding Officer, First Minister, Members of the Scottish Parliament, The Duke of Edinburgh and I will continue to follow your progress with the closest of interest, and we extend to you all our warmest good wishes as you embark on this fifth session of Parliament.


A speech by The Queen in Nova Scotia, 2010
Votre Excellence, Monsieur le Premier Ministre du Canada, Votre Honneur, Monsieur le Premier Ministre de la Nouvelle-Écosse
Prince Philip and I are very glad to have returned to Nova Scotia today to begin this tour of Canada, my 22nd visit as Queen of Canada. My mother once said that this country felt like a home away from home for The Queen of Canada. Prime Minister, I am pleased to report that it still does and I am delighted to be back amongst you all.
It has been sixteen years since I was last here in Nova Scotia. Premier, there can be few places where the motto of One Hundred Thousand Welcomes is put into practice with such conviction. Prince Philip and I are so very grateful to you all for the warmth of your greeting.
La richesse de l’histoire et la vitalité de la culture des provinces et des territoires sont une source d’inspiration et une raison de célébrer pour tous les Canadiens. Alors que nous commençons notre visite ici en Nouvelle-Écosse, le prince Philip et moi-même envisageons avec plaisir de participer aux activités soulignant l’histoire canadienne de service – nous nous rappellerons la vitalité indéfectible des Micmacs, nous célébrerons le centenaire de la Marine canadienne et nous serons témoins de l’esprit de bénévolat qui a contribué à l’édification et à l’épanouissement des collectivités et du pays.
Canadians have, by their own endeavours, built a country and society which is widely-admired across the world. I am fortunate to have been a witness to many of the developments and accomplishments of modern Canada. As Queen of Canada for nearly six decades, my pride in this country remains undimmed. Thank you again for your welcome. It is very good to be home.


A speech by The Queen at the Patron's Lunch on The Mall
To everyone here today, and to those holding street parties elsewhere, I would like to say thank you for the wonderful support and encouragement that you continue to give me.
 I hope these happy celebrations will remind us of the many benefits that can flow when people come together for a common purpose, as families, friends, or neighbours.  And I pay tribute to the commitment, selfless devotion and generosity-of-spirit shown by the hundreds of charities and voluntary organisations represented here today.  You are an example to us all.
I much appreciate the kindness of all your birthday wishes, and have been delighted and moved by the many cards and messages I have received.  How I will feel if people are still singing “Happy Birthday” to me in December, remains to be seen!

A speech by The Queen at the opening of the Fifth Session of the National Assembly for Wales
Presiding Officer, Members of the National Assembly for Wales, thank you for your warm welcome and good wishes.
I am delighted to be here with you today on the occasion of the opening of the Fifth National Assembly for Wales, and I congratulate you on your election as Members of the Assembly.
I have continued to follow the Assembly's progress with close interest, and to note the remarkable record of achievement over the first four terms.  Though a relatively young parliamentary institution, you have established a reputation as a strong, accessible and forward-looking legislature, serving all the diverse communities of Wales. 
The Assembly can be proud of the way it has engaged with a broad audience across Wales and beyond, to create a better understanding of the important work that is undertaken here; and I am sure that you will continue to show innovation and leadership in the way that you communicate with all those you serve, and to involve them in your work.
When I was here in 2011, I noted that you would be passing Assembly Acts for the first time.  So I am pleased now to see the Assembly serving the people of Wales as a modern legislature, with full law-making powers.  It is an achievement in which all who care about Wales can take pride.  
The volume and complexity of your legislative responsibilities will increase still further during this Fifth Assembly, and you will also have the fiscal responsibilities flowing from the Wales Act 2014, including tax-raising powers for the first time.
Your responsibility is great and the expectations are high, but I have no doubt you will continue to succeed as you discharge these new duties.
Presiding Officer, Assembly Members, this Fifth Assembly marks a further significant development in the history of devolution in Wales.  I wish you every success as you prepare to meet the challenges of these constitutional changes and to help realise the potential of the Assembly for future generations. 

A speech by The Queen at the Royal Artillery Tercentenary Parade on 26th May, 2016
Master Gunner,
I last reviewed my Royal Regiment in 1984 in Dortmund and you have, consistent with your motto - Ubique - since then taken part in many operations, always adapting quickly to new circumstances that face the Armed Forces today.
In all the theatres of war and in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions throughout the world, you have served with great distinction, especially so in the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
It has indeed been a demanding period, for Gunners of all ranks and for your families who have so closely supported you.  You should be rightly proud of your achievements.
I congratulate you on the journey of the Captain-General’s Baton, which has so successfully reinforced the links between the Royal Regiment and the Commonwealth and our Allies and which, of course, characterises the strength and depth of my Regiment's commitment to our common cause of freedom and democracy around the world.
The Royal Regiment of Artillery has since 1716 proudly served the Nation all over the World and I wish all Gunners every success and good fortune in the future.

A speech by The Queen at the Irish State Banquet, 2011
A Uachtaráin agus a chairde (President and friends).
Prince Philip and I are delighted to be here, and to experience at first hand Ireland’s world-famous hospitality.
Together we have much to celebrate: the ties between our people, the shared values, and the economic, business and cultural links that make us so much more than just neighbours, that make us firm friends and equal partners.
Madam President, speaking here in Dublin Castle it is impossible to ignore the weight of history, as it was yesterday when you and I laid wreaths at the Garden of Remembrance.
Indeed, so much of this visit reminds us of the complexity of our history, its many layers and traditions, but also the importance of forbearance and conciliation. Of being able to bow to the past, but not be bound by it.
Of course, the relationship has not always been straightforward; nor has the record over the centuries been entirely benign. It is a sad and regrettable reality that through history our islands have experienced more than their fair share of heartache, turbulence and loss.
These events have touched us all, many of us personally, and are a painful legacy. We can never forget those who have died or been injured, and their families. To all those who have suffered as a consequence of our troubled past I extend my sincere thoughts and deep sympathy. With the benefit of historical hindsight we can all see things which we would wish had been done differently or not at all. But it is also true that no-one who looked to the future over the past centuries could have imagined the strength of the bonds that are now in place between the governments and the people of our two nations, the spirit of partnership that we now enjoy, and the lasting rapport between us. No-one here this evening could doubt that heartfelt desire of our two nations.
Madam President, you have done a great deal to promote this understanding and reconciliation. You set out to build bridges. And I have seen at first hand your success in bringing together different communities and traditions on this island. You have also shed new light on the sacrifice of those who served in the First World War. Even as we jointly opened the Messines Peace Park in 1998, it was difficult to look ahead to the time when you and I would be standing together at Islandbridge as we were today.
That transformation is also evident in the establishment of a successful power-sharing Executive in Northern Ireland. A knot of history that was painstakingly loosened by the British and Irish Governments together with the strength, vision and determination of the political parties in Northern Ireland.
What were once only hopes for the future have now come to pass; it is almost exactly 13 years since the overwhelming majority of people in Ireland and Northern Ireland voted in favour of the agreement signed on Good Friday 1998, paving the way for Northern Ireland to become the exciting and inspirational place that it is today. I applaud the work of all those involved in the peace process, and of all those who support and nurture peace, including members of the police, the Gardaí, and the other emergency services, and those who work in the communities, the churches and charitable bodies like Co-operation Ireland. Taken together, their work not only serves as a basis for reconciliation between our people and communities, but it gives hope to other peacemakers across the world that through sustained effort, peace can and will prevail.
For the world moves on quickly. The challenges of the past have been replaced by new economic challenges which will demand the same imagination and courage. The lessons from the peace process are clear; whatever life throws at us, our individual responses will be all the stronger for working together and sharing the load.
There are other stories written daily across these islands which do not find their voice in solemn pages of history books, or newspaper headlines, but which are at the heart of our shared narrative. Many British families have members who live in this country, as many Irish families have close relatives in the United Kingdom.
These families share the two islands; they have visited each other and have come home to each other over the years. They are the ordinary people who yearned for the peace and understanding we now have between our two nations and between the communities within those two nations; a living testament to how much in common we have.
These ties of family, friendship and affection are our most precious resource. They are the lifeblood of the partnership across these islands, a golden thread that runs through all our joint successes so far, and all we will go on to achieve. They are a reminder that we have much to do together to build a future for all our grandchildren: the kind of future our grandparents could only dream of.
So we celebrate together the widespread spirit of goodwill and deep mutual understanding that has served to make the relationship more harmonious, close as good neighbours should always be.

Christmas Broadcast 2015
At this time of year, few sights evoke more feelings of cheer and goodwill than the twinkling lights of a Christmas tree.
The popularity of a tree at Christmas is due in part to my great-great grandparents, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. After this touching picture was published, many families wanted a Christmas tree of their own, and the custom soon spread.
In 1949, I spent Christmas in Malta as a newly-married naval wife. We have returned to that island over the years, including last month for a meeting of Commonwealth leaders; and this year I met another group of leaders: The Queen's Young Leaders, an inspirational group, each of them a symbol of hope in their own Commonwealth communities.
Gathering round the tree gives us a chance to think about the year ahead -- I am looking forward to a busy 2016, though I have been warned I may have Happy Birthday sung to me more than once or twice. It also allows us to reflect on the year that has passed, as we think of those who are far away or no longer with us. Many people say the first Christmas after losing a loved one is particularly hard. But it’s also a time to remember all that we have to be thankful for.
It is true that the world has had to confront moments of darkness this year, but the Gospel of John contains a verse of great hope, often read at Christmas carol services: "The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."
One cause for thankfulness this summer was marking seventy years since the end of the Second World War. On VJ Day, we honoured the remaining veterans of that terrible conflict in the Far East, as well as remembering the thousands who never returned. The procession from Horse Guards Parade to Westminster Abbey must have been one of the slowest ever, because so many people wanted to say 'thank you' to them.
At the end of that War, the people of Oslo began sending an annual gift of a Christmas tree for Trafalgar Square. It has five hundred lightbulbs and is enjoyed not just by Christians but by people of all faiths, and of none. At the very top sits a bright star, to represent the Star of Bethlehem.
The custom of topping a tree also goes back to Prince Albert's time. For his family's tree, he chose an angel, helping to remind us that the focus of the Christmas story is on one particular family.For Joseph and Mary, the circumstances of Jesus's birth -- in a stable – were far from ideal, but worse was to come as the family was forced to flee the country. It’s no surprise that such a human story still captures our imagination and continues to inspire all of us who are Christians, the world over.
Despite being displaced and persecuted throughout his short life, Christ's unchanging message was not one of revenge or violence but simply that we should love one another. Although it is not an easy message to follow, we shouldn't be discouraged; rather, it inspires us to try harder: to be thankful for the people who bring love and happiness into our own lives, and to look for ways of spreading that love to others, whenever and wherever we can.
One of the joys of living a long life is watching one’s children, then grandchildren, then great grandchildren, help decorate the Christmas tree. And this year my family has a new member to join in the fun!
The customary decorations have changed little in the years since that picture of Victoria and Albert's tree first appeared, although of course electric lights have replaced the candles.
There’s an old saying that “it is better to light a candle than curse the darkness”.
There are millions of people lighting candles of hope in our world today. Christmas is a good time to be thankful for them, and for all that brings light to our lives.
I wish you a very happy Christmas.

A speech by The Queen at the CHOGM Dinner, Malta, 2015
Prime Minister Muscat,
As Head of the Commonwealth, it is with great pleasure that I welcome you all here this evening.
Thank you, Mr Prime Minister of Canada, for making me feel so old!
We are grateful to be with you for the second Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting hosted by Malta, and I hope that this occasion will allow you to gather as friends and enjoy Malta's hospitality.

A speech by The Queen at the Inauguration of the General Synod, 2015
Your Graces, the Convocations of Canterbury and York, duly called together in obedience to Our Royal Writs, are on this day joined together, in accordance with the Synodical Government Measure 1969, and the House of Laity is added to them in accordance with that Measure, so as to constitute the tenth General Synod of the Church of England.
Thank you, Archbishop, for your welcome and for setting today’s proceedings in a wider historical context. In the forty-five years since the meeting of the first Synod, much has changed.
The last Synod will be particularly remembered for the way in which, after prolonged reflection and conversation, even in the midst of deep disagreements, it was able to approve the legislation to enable women to be consecrated as bishops.
This new Synod too will have to grapple with the difficult issues confronting our Church and our world. On some of these there will be many different views.
And I am sure that members of the Synod will pray earnestly that the gathering in January of the Primates of the Anglican Communion will be a time when, together, they may know what is God’s will.
St. Paul reminds us that all Christians, as ambassadors for Christ, are entrusted with the ministry of reconciliation. Spreading God’s word and the onerous but rewarding task of peace-making and conflict resolution are important parts of that ministry. So too is the Church of England’s particular vocation to work in partnership with those of other faiths and none, to serve the common good in this land. To this end, I was pleased that one of the first events that Prince Philip and I attended in 2012 to mark my Diamond Jubilee was a gathering of leaders of all faiths, at Lambeth Palace.
The presence among us today of the Preacher to the Papal Household would not have been possible but for the notable advances since 1970 in co-operation across the great Christian traditions. There are many other examples. The Covenant between the Church of England and the Methodist Church; the recent visit of the Ecumenical Patriarch; the participation in this Synod of observers from so many Christian traditions; the newly created ecumenical community of St Anselm at Lambeth. Each of these serves as a reminder both of the progress already made and of the journey that still lies ahead in the pursuit of Christian unity.
Your Graces, each new Synod inherits from its predecessor the same weighty responsibilities. Collectively, you must continue to draw deeply on your faith, judgement, and life experiences, as well as that precious Anglican tradition of unity in fellowship, to discern the future path of the Church of England.
At the beginning of this new Synod, as you put your hand into the hand of God, my prayer is that, as we sang in that joyous hymn this morning, “His glorious light may shine ever on our sight, and clothe us round, the while our path illuming".

A speech by The Queen at the Home Office, 2015
To mark the tenth anniversary of the Civil Service Awards, I have come here today to learn more about the important work you all do to support the activity of government in its many different forms. I know that being a member of the Civil Service, and indeed being involved in public service of any sort, is not always an easy task. Even the best public servants cannot hope to be popular with everyone all the time; and - as in every walk of life - there is often room for improvement and finding fresh ways of doing things.
But occasionally it is right that we pause to recognise the vital work being done every day throughout the United Kingdom in the name of public service. From policy makers in Whitehall to public-facing staff across the country, we trust public servants to show integrity, stamina, and selfless duty, as well as essential values such as being fair, keeping one’s word, speaking the truth - even when that truth is unwelcome - and judging every case on its merits, often in trying or pressurised circumstances.
These unwritten but deep-rooted values, nurtured over the 160 years since the modern Civil Service was founded, are the essence of the British spirit of public service, which is recognised throughout the world, and it is important that they continue to be celebrated and encouraged. For instance, a short distance from here, the Westminster Abbey Institute works with public service institutions near and around Parliament Square to deepen thinking about values in public life. And this evening I will meet the finalists of this year’s Civil Service Awards, whose contributions are in areas as diverse as forestry, early years learning, and tackling Ebola.
A life of public service is an honourable calling: you have the opportunity to shape people’s lives, inspire others, and uphold the very highest standards. And so, to all of you here today, and to everyone whose role is to serve the needs of others, I want to say thank you for all that you do.

A speech by The Queen at the China State Banquet, 2015
Mr. President,
Prince Philip and I are delighted to welcome you and Madame Peng to Buckingham Palace this evening.
Your visit to the United Kingdom marks a milestone in this unprecedented year of co-operation and friendship between the United Kingdom and China, as we celebrate the ties between our two countries and prepare to take them to ambitious new heights.
The United Kingdom and China have a warm and longstanding friendship. Prince Philip and I recall with great fondness our visit to China almost thirty years ago, where we were privileged to experience your country’s rich history and culture, including the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and the Terracotta Warriors: all unforgettable memories of China’s ancient civilisation.
Yet it was China’s desire to shape a new future which captivated us the most. We were struck by the energy and enthusiasm with which China’s leaders were forging ahead with a new and ambitious future for the Chinese people; and I well recall our discussions with the late paramount leader Mr. Deng Xiaoping, who was foremost among these leaders in setting a clear direction for China with his policy of reform. It was also Mr. Deng’s visionary concept of One Country Two Systems which opened the way for the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty under the Sino-British Joint Declaration.
Almost thirty years later, Mr Deng’s vision has borne remarkable fruit. Rapid economic growth and development has transformed the lives of people across China and lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty: a huge and historic achievement with far reaching positive effects on people’s lives.
I was delighted that my grandson Prince William was able to witness these changes during his first visit to China earlier this year. Like myself and Prince Philip, he visited not only your great cities of Beijing and Shanghai but also the beautiful province of Yunnan, and saw at first-hand the strong connections which bind our two countries together, be they in culture, education or business.
Mr. President, the relationship between the United Kingdom and China is now truly a global partnership. We have much reason to celebrate the dynamic, growing economic relationship between our countries as well as our success in working together to address pressing international challenges.
We have, this year, marked the seventieth anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations. Today the world faces challenges which call for collaboration between the nations: conflict and terrorism; poverty and ill-health; conservation and climate change. As permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, Britain and China are stewards of the rules-based international system, and we have a responsibility to cooperate on these issues which have a direct bearing on the security and prosperity of all our peoples.
This global partnership is supported by an expanding network of links between the people of our two countries, which are essential in building mutual understanding and friendship, while we welcome the increasing numbers of Chinese tourists, students and business visitors to the United Kingdom.
Mr. President, your visit is a defining moment in this very special year for our bilateral relationship. I am confident that it will serve to highlight the sincerity and warmth of our friendship and to strengthen relations between our countries for many years to come.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I ask you to rise and drink a toast to the President and Madame Peng and to the people of China.

A speech by The Queen at the Borders Railway, Scotland
First Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Duke of Edinburgh and I are delighted to be back in the Borders today and, especially, to have arrived by train! It has been wonderful to witness the excitement which the return of the railway has brought here. The Borders Railway brings so much promise for sharing and invigorating this most beautiful countryside as a place to work, live and enjoy.
Prince Philip and I are very grateful for the warmth of your welcome on this occasion. Many including you, First Minister, have also kindly noted another significance attaching to today, although it is not one to which I have ever aspired. Inevitably, a long life can pass by many milestones; my own is no exception. But I thank you all, and the many others at home and overseas, for your touching messages of great kindness.
So now to the business in hand. It is my very happy duty to declare the Borders Railway open.

A speech by The Queen at the German State Banquet, 2015
Mr President
Prince Philip and I would like to thank you and Frau Schadt for the warm welcome you have given us at the start of our fifth State Visit to Germany. In the 50 years since our first visit, our countries have lived through many profound changes. I am very glad to record that one of the irreversible changes for the better in my lifetime has been in the relationship between the United Kingdom and Germany.
Mr President, it falls to a Head of State to lead a nation in the marking of anniversaries. Every month this year we commemorate either the centenary of a momentous event in the First World War; the 70th anniversary of a milestone at the end of the Second World War; or, here in Germany, 25 years of reunification following the fall of the wall which divided this city and this nation for so long.
But, tonight, I would also like to cast back rather further in time. Last week in a water-meadow by the River Thames, I attended an event to celebrate the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta. Of course, in common with other events in our remote history, the precise facts of 1215 are disputed. The consequences of the agreement between King John and his barons, however, are not disputed: for the first time we established in England that no man should be above the law and that individuals as well as rulers have rights. Thus began the long, slow and interrupted process of our country's evolution into a democracy.
Tomorrow I shall visit St Paul’s Church, where the first freely-elected legislature in Germany met in 1848. The Frankfurt Parliament turned out to be a false dawn; it took another century and the loss of the most terrible wars in history to set Germany on the path of democracy.
Earlier this year my cousins visited Germany to mark with you, Mr President, more recent and painful anniversaries. The Duke of Kent visited Dresden and The Duke of Gloucester visited Bergen-Belsen. I myself shall visit Bergen-Belsen on Friday. These visits underline the complete reconciliation between our countries.
Germany has reconciled with all her neighbours. I pay tribute to the work of the German statesmen since the Second World War who reinvented Germany and helped to rebuild Europe. I met Chancellor Adenauer at Windsor in 1958. He rejected the idea of a neutral Germany, preferring to anchor Germany in the West. His successors took up the challenge of uniting Germany as a member of all the institutions of Europe and the West.
Since 1945 the United Kingdom has determined to number among Germany's very strongest friends in Europe. In the intervening decades, Britain and Germany have achieved so much by working together. I have every confidence that we will continue to do so in the years ahead.
Since Berlin and Germany were reunited there has been much to celebrate. Today I cruised with you, Mr President, along the Spree. I saw fewer cranes than when I was last here in 2004. But still the most magnificent element of Berlin’s skyline is the Reichstag dome, an enduring reminder of our cultural cooperation. Our work together includes every part of life, from politics to commerce, from industry to every aspect of the arts, in particular, music, museums and education.
We also saw a wonderful example of partnership in education and science during our visit to the Technical University this afternoon. The enthusiasm and interest our students and young people have for each other’s ideas and work is our greatest asset: the next generation is at ease with itself and with contemporaries across Europe in a way that was never the case before.
The United Kingdom has always been closely involved in its continent. Even when our main focus was elsewhere in the world, our people played a key part in Europe. In the nineteenth century in the Russian Empire a Welsh engineer called John Hughes founded a mining town which is now Donetsk in Ukraine. And in the seventeenth century a Scottish publican called Richard Cant moved his family to Pomerania; his son moved further East to Memel and his grandson then moved South to Königsberg, where Richard’s great-grandson, Immanuel Kant, was born.
In our lives, Mr President, we have seen the worst but also the best of our continent. We have witnessed how quickly things can change for the better. But we know that we must work hard to maintain the benefits of the post-war world. We know that division in Europe is dangerous and that we must guard against it in the West as well as in the East of our continent. That remains a common endeavour.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I ask you to rise and drink a toast to the President and the people of Germany.

A speech by The Queen at the Women's Institute centenary AGM
I am delighted to join you here today for the national Annual General Meeting in this, the 100th year of the Women's Institute in Britain.
In the century since the first W.I. groups were formed in North Wales and in Sussex, so much has changed for women in our society.
There has been significant economic and social change since 1915. Women have been granted the vote, British women have climbed Everest for the first time and the country has elected its first female Prime Minister.
The Women's Institute has been a constant throughout, gathering women together, encouraging them to acquire new skills and nurturing unique talents.
In the modern world, the opportunities for women to give something of value to society are greater than ever, because, through their own efforts, they now play a much greater part in all areas of public life.
Over the past 100 years, the W.I. has continued to grow and evolve with its members to stay relevant and forward-thinking.
In 2015 it continues to demonstrate that it can make a real difference to the lives of women of all ages and cultural backgrounds, in a spirit of friendship, cooperation and support.
I congratulate you all on this significant occasion and formally declare this Annual General Meeting open.`;
