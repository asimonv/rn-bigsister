const text = `I. POEMS OF THE MOTHERS
I was kissed
I was kissed, and I am othered: another, because of the pulse that echoes the
pulse in my veins; another, because of the breath I feel within my breath.
My belly, now, is as noble as my heart . . .
And now I feel in my own breathing an exhalation of flowers: all because
of the one who rests inside me gently, as the dew on the grass!

What Will He Be Like?
What will he be like? I gazed for a long time at the petals of a rose, and I
touched them delightedly: I would want that softness for his cheeks. And I
played in a tangle of brambles, because I would want his hair to be like that,
dark and curling. But it won’t matter if it is bronze colored, with the rich color
of red clay that potters love, or if his smooth hair is as simple as my whole life.
I watch the hollows in the mountains as they fill with fog, and I sketch
with the fog the silhouette of a girl, a very sweet little girl: my child could
be like that too…
But, above all, I want that face to share the sweetness he has in his face,
and that voice to share the timbre of his voice when he speaks to me: for in
the one who is to come, I want to love the one who kissed me.

Wisdom
Now I understand why for these twenty summers I have felt the sunshine
on me and why I was given to gathering flowers in the fields. Why, I’d ask
myself on the most beautiful days, this wonderful gift of the warm sun and
the fresh grass?
As if I were a cluster of blue-tinged grapes, the light passed through me
for the sweetness I might yield. This that is making itself in the depths of me,
drop by drop, from my veins: this was my wine.
For this I prayed, the name of God passing through my human clay, with which it would be made. And when with a fluttering pulse I’d read a poem, I’d be scorched by its beauty, that he could absorb his inextinguishable warmth from my flesh.

The Sweetness
Because of the sleeping child I carry, my footstep has turned cautious. And
my whole heart is religious, since it carries this mystery.
My voice is so, as if quieted by love, and it’s just that I fear awakening it.
In the faces I see I search for signs of an inner pain, so that others might see and understand why my cheek has turned pale.
In tender fear, I pick my way through the grasses where the quails nest.
And I pass through the quiet countryside, heedfully. I believe that the trees and material things hold sleeping children, over whom they keep watch.

The Sister
Today I watched a woman plow a furrow. Her hips are swollen, like mine, by love, and her work made her bend toward the ground.
I put my arm around her waist; I brought her home with me. She will drink rich milk from the same glass I do, and she’ll make herself at home in the shade of my verandah, gravid in the heaviness of love. And if my breast is
not plentiful enough, my child will reach his lips toward hers, which is rich.

The Prayer
But no! Would God let the buds of my breasts dry up, when He Himself
widened my waist? I feel my breasts grow, swelling like water in a wide pool,
silently. And their softness casts a shadow like a promise across my belly.
Who in all the valley would be poorer than I, if my breasts never did moisten?
Like the vessels that women set out at night to catch the dew, I place my breasts before God; I give Him a new name, He Who Fills, and I ask Him for the fluid of life, in abundance. My child will come thirstily, searching for it.

Sensitive
I don’t play in the meadows any more, and I am afraid, now, to swing back and forth with the young country girls. I am like a branch full of fruit.
I am weak, so weak the smell of the roses made me faint during the siesta, when I went down to the garden, and a simple song carried on the wind, or the afternoon’s last pulsing drop of blood in the sky, disturbs me, flooding me with sadness. If even one glance from my master were harsh toward me tonight, I might die.

The Eternal Grief
I go pale if he feels pain inside me; a feeling of broken heartedness presses in on me, and I could die from a single movement of the one who is within me, whom I don’t see.
Don’t think he’ll occupy me so and be interwoven with me, only while I carry him. When someday he roams free on the roads, even though far away, the wind that lashes him will slash at my flesh too, and his cry will
pass through my throat too. My weeping and my laughter will begin in your face, my child!

For Him
For him, for the sake of the one who is drowsy now, like a thread of water
under the grass, don’t hurt me, don’t give me more chores. Pardon me everything:
how the table full of food bothers me, how loud noises annoy me.
You can tell me all about the household problems, about the poverty and
the worry —but after I’ve put him in diapers.
On the forehead, the breast, wherever you touch me, it is he, and he’d
let out an echoing cry if I were hurt.

The Hush
I can’t go out in public anymore: I feel shy about my bulky waist and the
puffy bags under my eyes. So bring things to me here, set a vase of flowers
beside me, play the zither for a while: for his sake, I want to surround myself
with beauty.
I lay roses across my belly, I recite ageless poems above the sleeper. On
the verandah, hour after hour, I take in the tang of the sun. I want to distill,
as the fruit does, honey, in my core. May I feel the wind from the pine
groves across my face. The light and the breezes ripen and clean my blood.
To cleanse it even more, I feel no hatred, I make no complaint: I love, only
that! Because, in this silence, in this hush, I am knitting a body, a miraculous
body, with veins, and a face, and a gaze, and a purified heart.

Little White Clothes
I knit the little slippers, I cut so diapers: I want to make everything with
my own hands.
He will come from my insides; he will recognize my scent.
So fleece of the ewe: this summer they sheared you for him. The ewe
grew it fluffy for eight months, and the January moon bleached it white. It
has no thistle needles or blackberry thorns in it. The fleece of my flesh is just
that so, where he has been sleeping.
Little white clothes! He sees them through my eyes, and he smiles, happy,
sensing in advance how very so…

Image of the Earth
I had never seen, before now, the true image of the Earth. The Earth has the bearing of a woman with a child in her arms—with her creatures in her broad arms.
I’m learning a maternal awareness of things. The mountain that watches me: it, too, is a mother, and at evening the fog plays like a child across her shoulders and her lap.
Now I remember a ravine in the valley. Through its deep bed ran a singing current, wholly hidden by the weedy terrain. I am like that ravine now; I feel this little brook singing inside me, and I have given him my flesh for terrain, till he rises toward the light.

To the Husband
Husband, don’t embrace me. You made him rise from the depths of my being
like a water lily. Leave me be, like water at rest.
Love me, love me now a little more! I —so small— will send a copy of you into the streets. I —so poor— will give you other eyes, other lips, with which you’ll have and hold the world; I —so fragile— will crack apart like an amphora for love’s sake, so that this wine of life will spill from me.
Forgive me! I walk so clumsily; I serve your cup so clumsily; but you
filled me like this, you gave me this strangeness with which I move among
things.
Be sweeter than ever with me. Don’t roil my blood with worries; don’t make my breath shiver. Now I am only a veil! My whole body is a veil across a sleeping child!

The Mother
My mother came to see me; she was sitting here beside me, and, for the first time in our lives, we were two sisters, talking about the tremendous event. 
Tremblingly, she felt my belly, and she gently uncovered my breast. At the touch of her hand it seemed to me my insides were half opening with the gentleness of leaves, and a milky wave was rising through my breast.
Flushed, full of confusion, I told her about my worries and about how I feared my own flesh; I dropped onto her breast, and once again I was the little girl who sobbed in her arms, terrified of life!

Tell Me, Mother . . .
Mother, tell me everything you learned from your old pains. Tell me about childbirth, how his little body will come out, webbed in the threads of my womb.
Tell me whether he’ll search on his own for my breast, or whether I should offer it to him, urging him.
Impart what you know about love to me, now, Mother. Teach me new caresses, gentle ones, gentler than a husband’s.
How will I wash his little head, in the days to come? And how will I wrap him without hurting him?
Teach me, Mother, the lullaby you rocked me with. Better than other songs, that one will soothe him to sleep.

The Dawn
All night I suffered; all night my flesh trembled to yield its gi. The sweat of death is on my temples, but it isn’t death, it’s life!
And now I call out an Infinite Sweetness to You, Lord, that you may loosen him from me gently.
Let him be born, and let my cry of pain rise in the dawn, woven with the song of birds!

The Sacred Law
They say the life has flowed from my body, that my veins have drained themselves like winepresses, but I feel only a relief in my chest, as after a long sigh.
‘‘Who am I,’’ I ask myself, ‘‘to have a child on my lap?’’
And I answer:
‘‘I am a woman who loved, and whose love reached, when I was kissed, toward eternity”.
May the Earth see me with this child in my arms; may it bless me, for I am fruitful and sacred, like the palm trees and the furrows of the field.

II. POEMS OF THE SADDEST MOTHER
Thrown Out
My father said he’d kick me out, he shouted at my mother that he’d throw me out this very night.
The night is mild; by the clear light of the stars, I could walk as far as the nearest village, but, what if he’s born while I do? My crying has called to him, maybe; maybe he wants to come out to see my face full of tears. And he’d shiver in the raw air, though I would cover him.

Why Did You Come?
Why did you come? No one will love you, although you are beautiful, my child. Though you smile happily, like the other children, like the youngest of my little brothers, no one will kiss you but me, my child. And though your little hands might reach out for toys, you’ll have nothing for your games but
my breasts and the strings of my tears, my child. Why did you come, if the one who brought you hated you when he felt you in my belly? But no! You came for me; for me because I was alone, alone even when he held me close in his arms, my child!

NOTE:
One afternoon, while I was walking down a poor street in Temuco, I saw a village woman sitting in the doorway of her shack. She was heavily pregnant, her face full of deep affliction. A man passed by and flung some crude remark at her, which made her
blush. At that moment I felt all the solidarity of my sex, the vast compassion of women for women, and it set me to thinking:
‘‘It’s up to one of us women (since men haven’t said anything about it) to tell about the holiness of this condition, which is both painful and divine. If the mission of art is to show the beauty of everything, with an immense compassion, why have we not shown, for the eyes of those who are impure, the purity of this?’’
So I wrote the preceding poems, with an almost religious purpose. Some of those women who feel they have to shut their eyes to cruel but fatal reality in order to maintain their own purity have aimed small-minded criticism at these poems, which saddened me, for their sakes. They even intimated that I should drop the poems from the book. 
In this self-involved work, work that feels diminished to me because of
that self-involvement, it may very well be that this human prose is the only part in which the fullness of Life sings. Should I drop them?
No! Here they stay, dedicated to those women who can see that the sanctity
of life begins with motherhood, which is, accordingly, sacred. I want them to feel the tenderness with which a woman who cares for the children of others looks upon the mothers of all the children of the world!
